How to navigate through Slipstream content
	
1. Pickups are items and equipment (minus elite equipments).
2. Scripts and their related assets are paired with each other (ItemDef, Script, Pickup ect.)
3. Buffs, EntityStates, Prefabs, Textures, Materials, Definitions, etc. are all paired with each other. For example if you are trying to find the buff for Pepper Spray (PepperSpeed), go to Pickups -> Items -> Pepperspray and the buff is there.
4. Scenes are not in here as they would prevent building the mod if they are paired with any other asset.
5. GeneralMaterials aren't specific to anything.
