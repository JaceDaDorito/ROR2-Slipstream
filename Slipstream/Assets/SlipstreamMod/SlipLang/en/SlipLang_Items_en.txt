What happened is still fresh in my mind, that’s all I know. I still have that picture of us in front of our house. It was cloudy that day, with the endless waves of aircraft leaving little room for sunlight. For a second, I thought they were ours. In the next second, the quiet streets were set ablaze by ear-splitting blasts. Windows shattered, shrapnel cut through me, the shape of our home succumbed to the flames. In a panic, I ran. I picked a direction and stuck to it, I think…”\n\n…\n\n“I think the explosions stopped. I don’t know how long it’s been. It’s the dead of night and I’m too scared to go back out. I don’t know who’s out there. I was patched up since the attack started, but it didn’t hold up long. I’m bleeding again, but no matter what, I won’t rest until I find you, Maurice. I’m out of paper at this point, so if anyone finds this, look for someone with a bracelet similar to this. It should say the word “best” on it. I’m not sure what’ll happen to me, so give this to him, too.”\n\nVolunteer rescue teams found a backpack that contained a badly damaged camera, a full small journal, several bundles of tattered cloth, and two colorful bracelets outside the ruins of a local market building. No body was found.\"",

	"SLIP_ITEM_GLASSEYE_LORE": "Like most technological marvels before it, bionics – touted as the greatest advancement in medical science since discovery of Penicillin – quickly became a topic of public obsession, to the point of hysteria across both Earth & Mars.\n\nMany people desiring bionic “upgrades” – for one reason or another – went to extreme lengths in order to reach their goals. Some repeatedly broke bones in order to qualify for titanium implants throughout their bodies, others arranged accidents in order to gain a mechanical arm or leg.\n\nIn one case, the famous ‘William R Smith’ – known as an early advocate for personal shielding technologies – reportedly gouged out their right eye with a pair of gardening sheers with the intent of replacing the eye with a self-made, bionic glass eye.\n\nUniquely, this bionic eye used an integrated shield generator in place of the standard mechanical lens used at the time, using the glass structure of the eye as a medium to control the shield-based lens instead.\n\n-    A history of early bionics, Chapter 2 – Public Perception, Overall Obsession",
