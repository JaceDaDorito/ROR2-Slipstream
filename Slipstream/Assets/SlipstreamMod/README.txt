#Slipstream
Slipstream is an in-the-works content mod that aims to vary your Risk of Rain 2 runs with build defining items, brand-new enemy encounters, and breath taking locales. We hope to make Petrichor V a wild ride to explore!

Currently, we don't have stages or many items but we are working hard to try and add some soon. Contact (JaceDaDorito#7035) on Discord if there is any issues, most of the devs here are extremely new to modding so be patient.
