## Description
---------------------------
DebuggingPlains is a mod for ROR2 mod developers designed to help with the mod debugging process a lil bit :)

Key features:
- Allows you to head staright into a start of a run as you open the game instead of navigating through menus every time
- Configurable config file to customize your debug run (selected stage, character, artifacts, difficulty etc.)
- Configurable config file to customize your maps (spawn locations, objects to spawn at the start of the run, etc.)

## Install
-----------------------------
- Unzip and place the dll in the plugin folder of Bepinex
- run the game first time to let the plugin create the 2 config files in the config folder
- customize your run preferences by editing the mod's .cfg file at the config folder, and your maps preferences by editing the scenesConfig.json file - both files are very indicative for editing
- Enjoy :)


## Future Updates
-----------------------------
i'm planning to add:

- XYZ character location indicator at the bottom of the screen to help you with position related stuff
- spawn option as monster as well :)
- currently i've prepared 1 "debug location" for you to use at golemplains (you can find it in the maps json file), i'm planning to make more like this in the future and maybe even create a debug map
- configurable stage list instead of a single stage

## Compatibility / Issues
-----------------------------
This is the very first version of this mod and obviously will have a few bugs. i'm working hard to make this mod the most intuitive and comfortable for you, so please feel free to use it, break it, shred it, destroy it and i'll be very happy to hear about it and fix it.

feel free to contact me about anything :)
