# RoR2EditorKit - Editor Utilities, Inspectors and More for Risk of Rain2

## About

RoR2EditorKit is a *Thunderkit Extension* for developing mods inside the UnityEditor, providing a myriad of Inspectors, Property Drawers, Editor Windows and more.

At it's core, RoR2EditorKit should not have any classes or systems that depend on runtime usage, RoR2EditorKit works exclusively for speeding up the modding enviroment.

## Manual Installation

To Download RoR2EditorKit to your project, it is recommended that you either add it via the ThunderKit extension store, or adding it via Unity's PackageManager (Downloading a specific tagged version is recommended).

Once installed, it is heavily reccommended to open the ThunderkitSettings window to modify certain settings that RoR2EditorKit will use while helping you develop the mod.

* RoR2EditorKitSettings: Settings of the extension itself
 * Token Prefix: A prefix for your mod, it's used to generate unique tokens.
 * Main Manifest: The manifest of your mod, used in a myriad of tools to know the assetbundle or the main DLL.

## Extending RoR2EditorKit's Functionality.

* In case you need to extend RoR2EditorKit's functionality for your own purposes (Such as a custom inspector for a mod you're working on), you can look into this wiki page that explains how to extend the editor's functionality using RoR2EditorKit's systems.
